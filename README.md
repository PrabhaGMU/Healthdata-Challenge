Title: Exploring the Relationship Between Length of Stay and Total Bill Cost: A Linear Regression Analysis in Hospital Management

Abstract:
Efficient hospital management hinges on optimizing patient length of stay (LOS) and controlling costs. This study employs linear regression to investigate the impact of LOS on total bill costs per admission, aiming to discern the relationship while considering confounding factors. Preliminary findings suggest a significant association, highlighting the importance of LOS in healthcare expenditure. Insights from this analysis can inform strategies for resource allocation and cost containment in hospitals.
